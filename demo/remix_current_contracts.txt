View contracts
To see contacts do the following:

Install MetaMask
In MetaMask: select Main Ethereum Network
Find a contract on etherscan with source code, for example: https://etherscan.io/address/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca#code
Check out the compiler version, e.g.: v0.4.16+commit.d7661dd9
In Remix, via the plugin manager: add "Solidity compiler" and "Deploy & run transactions"
In file manager: create a new file (+).
Copy & Paste the source code of the contract from etherscan to remix
Select Solidity compiler and select the appropriate compiler version (v0.4.16+commit.d7661dd9)
Click "compile"
Select Deploy & run transactions
Select "Injected Web3" in the Environment dropdown
Paste the address of the contact (e.g. 0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca) in the "At Address" field
Now you can interact with the contract. You can select other interfaces in the dropdown box in the middle and press "At Address" again.
